4A Assignment - Annotation completed in online link provided
Also Sent email to admin, content as follows:

"have annotated all the images and saved them using 'SAVE PROJECT' button. But when I am logging-in again or reloading the page, at first 
instance it is showing as "Annotated : 0, Remaining : 104" . However, when I select one of the images, it is gets correctly updated 
to "Annotated: 0, Remaining : 104" and I can see all the annotations that I saved with region & details. Hope this is fine. "
